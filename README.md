# Music Database
![alt text](public/screenshot.png)

## Introduction
Because I want more knowledge of coding and using databases with coding I make this project. I use a Mongodb database for the storage of the data. Material UI is a nice css framework combined with ReactJS so I was allowed to give all my focus on the code instead of de styling. This repository is part 1 of the application. This is the cliënt version you can find the server with the following [link](#).

## What I use
I use different technologies and frameworks for this application. Below is a list of technologies I use:

- ReactJS: 
Framework for building in components

- Redux
Global state storage

- Material UI
Styling library for React components

- Axios
Send requests to the server

I use also NodeJS and MongoDB but I use that on the server instead of the cliënt.
